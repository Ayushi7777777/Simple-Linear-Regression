# Simple Linear Regression - My First ML Project 

This is my first machine learning project using the California Housing dataset.

##  What I did:
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Applied **Simple Linear Regression** using `sklearn` 
- Split data into training and test sets
- Standardized the features
- Made predictions and calculated model score

##  File Included:
- `LinearRegressionProject.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and explanations

##  What's Next: 
I'll try Ridge Regression and improve my model performance!
